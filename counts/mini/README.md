# Mini counts

Mini publishes a scored file when the desk's matching file is on origin. HOLD-4 waits for the bot file, the halt file, or 10 minutes, as [GO-MINI.md](../../GO-MINI.md) says. Mini counts only on its own synced TN10 node.

| File | Target |
|---|---|
| BASE.md | 0 tx/s, families only, an observation. The first line is `OBSERVATION` |
| HOLD-1.md | OBS-1: families only, 12 whole minutes (pre-run 12 has no payment offer) |
| HOLD-2.md | OBS-2: families only, 12 whole minutes |
| HOLD-3.md | OBS-3: families only, 12 whole minutes |
| HOLD-4.md | the observation minute |
| RETURN.md | 0 tx/s, families only |

In pre-run 12 the desk counter is the first chain count and Mini is the second read. Each file's first line is Mini's own read: `READ`, `PARTIAL`, or `NOT READ`. The chat does not publish this folder.
